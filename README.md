# IBM Applied D.S Capstone Project
This repository contains my approach to solving the assignments of the Coursera course Applied Data Science Capstone offered by IBM. ( ⭐️ Star repo on GitHub — it helps! )

I build this capstone undertaking to give you a sample of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. It uses location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. This task exhibits how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve information about venues in different neighborhoods around the globe. During the project, I have figured out how to be creative in circumstances where data are not readily available by scratching web information and parsing HTML code. I have used Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data. At long last, I have utilized the Folium library to extraordinary maps of geospatial information and to impart my outcomes and discoveries.
